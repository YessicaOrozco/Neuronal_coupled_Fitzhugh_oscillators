In this model the FitzHugh system was used as a starting point, which was modified by adding coupled oscillators. Both systems and the zeroclines are presented.

The phase plane plot and the time versus electric potential (voltage) graphs are sketched in the main code.

Although a single code can accommodate all possible scenarios, a code is presented for each graph presented in the article, to show how changing the value of the parameter k (make it different from zero) causes the oscillators to be coupled. In the same way, changing the initial conditions causes regime I or II.

- The necessary libraries are presented at the beginning of the code.
- No extra installation is necessary.
