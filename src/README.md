For this system, the FitzHugh model was used as a starting point, then it was modified by adding coupled oscillators. Both systems and the nullclines are presented.

The phase plane plot and the time versus electric potential (voltage) graphs are sketched in the main code.

Although a single code can present all possible scenarios, a code for each graph in the article is presented, in order to show how changing the value of the parameter k (a value different from zero) causes the oscillators to be coupled. In the same way, changing the initial conditions causes regime I or II.

- The necessary libraries are presented at the beginning of the code.
- No extra installation is necessary.
