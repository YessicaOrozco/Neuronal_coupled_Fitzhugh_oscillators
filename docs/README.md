# Modeling generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures with coupled Fitzhugh oscillators

This project contains the code developed for the article "Modeling generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures with coupled Fitzhugh oscillators" published in 2025. Here, we propose a mathematical model based on coupled FitzHugh oscillators in which their transition from harmonic oscillations to a disordered oscillatory regime can be observed. 

The results obtained are comparable with generalized tonic-clonic seizures shown by EEG. while  the oscillator death could be comparable to postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression. In our model, it was achieved either by changing the systemâ€™s charging capacity or the initial conditions.

### Keywords: neural model, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, FitzHugh Model.

 - No external data are needed
 - In the output folder, you can find some of the Figures that the code can do. These include limit cycles (where parameters are reported), and time versus voltage plots.
 - The source folder, contains the code. There is just one code, since only by changing the value of the parameter k (make it different from zero), the oscillators are coupled. In the same way, change the initial conditions, causes regime I or II.
 
 
 It is not necessary to install extra libraries other than those presented at the beginning of the code.
