## Modeling generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures with coupled Fitzhugh oscillators

This project contains the code developed for the article "Modeling generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures with coupled Fitzhugh oscillators" published in 2025. Here, we propose a mathematical model based on coupled FitzHugh oscillators in which their transition from harmonic oscillations to a disordered oscillatory regime can be observed. 

The results obtained are comparable with generalized tonic-clonic seizures shown by EEG and the oscillator death, comparable to postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression. In our model it was achieved either by changing the systemâ€™s charging capacity or the initial conditions.
